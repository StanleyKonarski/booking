# Booking

This is my first elixir app designed to book hotel rooms. You can book rooms, view your reservations and cancel them anytime. There is hardcoded admin account for developing purposes setup in seeds.exs file. I'm still developing this app, currently im working on proper OAuth login with PowAssent and on adding more custom validations.

If you were to run this app, you may need to change my postgres password to yours in config/dev.exs line 6.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
